# Lecture 4: Model Universes and Distances Measures
The main idea of this lecture is to see ways of determining the densities of the different components in the energy budget of the universe, and how these determine the expansion rate of the universe (which we can do to first order by exploring models with only one of these components). On the second part, we explore different distance definitions that can be used meaningfully in an expanding universe.

# Densities at Present
From [[LEC3 Cosmic Dynamics]], we learned that the Friedmann Equation can be expressed as:

$$
H^2(z) = H_0^2[\Omega_{m,0}a^{-3} + \Omega_{r,0}a^{-4} + \Omega_{\Lambda} + \Omega_{k,0}a^{-2}]
$$

Where each density parameter $\Omega$ is the ratio of the density of each component $\rho$ with respect to the critical density $\rho_c$ (the density required for a flat universe). Since the universe is seen to be flat, $\Omega_{k,0} = 0$, its easy to see that:

$$
\Omega_{m,0} + \Omega_{r,0} + \Omega_\Lambda = 1
$$

From observations, it has been measured that the energy budget of the universe is as follows:

$$
\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7
$$
$$
\Omega_{r,0} \approx 0.3
$$
$$
\Omega_{r,0} \approx 10^{-5}
$$

We can now explore each component with a little more detail.

## Radiation
To be more precise, this component considers not only photons, but any relativistic particles (such as neutrinos). As we just saw, this component is basically negligible at present time, at it is currently dominated by the CMB. To a high accuracy, the CMB is a black body with a temperature $T = 2.73 K$. Thus, we can get a value for the current density $\rho_{\gamma, 0}$ using the BB radiation field:

$$
\rho_\gamma c^2 = \frac{4\sigma_{SB}T^4}{c} \implies \rho_{\gamma, 0} \approx 5.1 \times10^{-5}
$$
