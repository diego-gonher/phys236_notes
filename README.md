# Phys236 Notes

Copy of my Obsidian Vault that contains my review notes for PHYS236 Cosmolgy. To have your own local Obsidian Vault, you can find installations instructions [here](https://obsidian.md).

Once you have installed Obsidian and cloned this repository, you can launch the app and go to *File >> Open Vault... >> Open folder as vault*, navigate to the directory where your local copy of all the notes are stored and click *Open*.

**Check the Cosmology.md to understand the structure of the notes**
